Hey there! I'm Ruth, a third year PhD student in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at University of California, Berkeley. 

I'm advised by Duncan Callaway - check out our group's website [here](https://emac.berkeley.edu/). 

I'm interested in all things power grids, renewable energy integration, and electricity markets. For more info on what I'm currently working on, check out [projects](/projects/).

I have a B.Eng (Research & Development) and a B.A (Philosophy, Economics) from the Australian National University. I previously worked at [ITP Renewables](https://www.itpau.com.au/) as an undergraduate engineer, and at the [Battery Storage and Grid Integration Program](https://bsgip.com/) as a research assistant.
