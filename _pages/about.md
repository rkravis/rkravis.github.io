Hey there! I'm Ruth, and I'm a first year PhD Student in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at University of California, Berkeley. I have a B.Eng (Research & Development) and a B.A (Philosophy, Economics) from the Australian National University. I previously worked at [ITP Renewables](https://www.itpau.com.au/) as an undergraduate engineer, and at the [Battery Storage and Grid Integration Program](https://bsgip.com/) as a research assistant.

I'm interested in how advances in sensing, control, and optimization can be leveraged to transition our energy systems towards decarbonisation. 

If you want to connect, feel free to get in touch :)
